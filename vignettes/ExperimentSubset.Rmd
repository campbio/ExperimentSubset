# A Brief Description
`ExperimentSubset` package makes it possible for the users to create subsets of
single cell experiment data and the consequent storage of this subset data back 
into a single comprehensive object. In addition, the methods available with the
package offer a convenient way to perform necessary operations on the subsets
of data by overriding the common methods of the `SingleCellExperiment` and
`SummarizedExperiment` packages adding support for subsets.

The `ExperimentSubset` class offers the same interface to the users as the 
`SingleCellExperiment` and `SummarizedExperiment` classes, except for the 
additional parameters to support for subsets of data. This is accomplished by
only storing the references to the indices of `rows` and `columns` of the 
subsets in the parent `assay` to conserve memory. However, additional data can
still be stored inside a particular subset which may include additional 
`assays` and `rowData`/`colData` against a subset.

# Overview of the `ExperimentSubset` class
As `ExperimentSubset` class inherits from `SingleCellExperiment` and 
`SummarizedExperiment` classes, it follows the same internal structure as the
latter two except the addition of subsets slot. A more obvious structure of the 
`ExperimentSubset` class object is described below.

Apart from the inherited slots from `SingleCellExperiment` (which work exactly
as they should normally do), there is an addition of a `subsets` slot that
stores a `list` of all subsets in the object. Each of these subsets inside the 
`ExperimentSubset` object is stored as `SingleCellSubset` instance. This 
`SingleCellSubset` instance creates reference to the row and column indices for 
this particular subset against a stored parent assay. In case additional data
needs to be stored against a subset i.e. additional `assays`, `rowData`, 
`colData`, `altExp`, `reducedDims` and `metadata`, can be stored inside this
subset in an internal `SingleCellExperiment` object which has dimensions equal
to the subset. The overall internal structure of a subset contains the following
components:

[Add figure here]

## subsetName
A `character` string that represents the name of the subset. This 
`subsetName` field is used to access and manipulate the contents of the subset.

## rowIndices
A `numeric` `vector` that represents the indices of the rows in the 
parent `assay` which are included in the subset.

## colIndices
A `numeric` `vector` that represents the indices of the columns in the 
parent `assay` which are included in the subset.

## parentAssay
A `character` string that indicates the name of the `assay` which is the parent 
of this subset.

## internalAssay
A `SingleCellExperiment` object which is initially empty but can be used to 
store additional subset data i.e. additional `assays`, `rowData`, `colData`, 
`altExp`, `reducedDims` and `metadata` against this subset.

# Main methods of `ExperimentSubset` class
## `ExperimentSubset()` constructor
The constructor is used to initialize an `ExperimentSubset` object either by
passing a `SingleCellExperiment` or `SummarizedExperiment` object for implicit
conversion or explicitly by passing the same parameters to the
`ExperimentSubset` object as one would to the `SingleCellExperiment` 
constructor. The optional `subset` parameter which is a named `list` (list
parameters must be specified against `subsetName`, `rowIndices`, `colIndices`
and `parentAssay`) allows the creation of a subset directly from the 
constructor.

## `createSubset`: Create a subset
The `createSubset` function allows the explicit creation of a subset in an
`ExperimentSubset` object from a parent by specifying the `subsetName`, 
`rowIndices`, `colIndices` and `parentAssay`. The parent can be a main `assay` 
from the object, an another subset or a subset `assay`.

## `storeSubset`: Store a subset `assay`
The `storeSubset` function differs from the `createSubset` function in the sense
that it allows the storage of subset `assays` in an already created subset or
it can directly create a new subset and store the `assay` inside this subset.
It takes input a `matrix` style assay, more specifically a `sparse` `matrix`
which is then stored in the `internalAssay` slot of the subset.
