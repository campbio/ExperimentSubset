Description: Experiment objects such as the SummarizedExperiment or SingleCellExperiment are data containers for one or more matrix-like assays along with the associated row and column data. Often only a subset of the original data is needed for down-stream analysis. For example, filtering out poor quality samples will require excluding some columns before analysis. The ExperimentSubset object is a container to efficiently manage different subsets of the same data without having to make separate objects for each new subset.
